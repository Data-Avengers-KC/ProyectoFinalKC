Using Git LFS pointers with MLflow is not recommended because MLflow expects proper YAML/JSON files for its metadata (like meta.yaml), not Git LFS pointers. However, if you must combine them (e.g., for versioning large artifacts), hereâ€™s how to do it safely:

.gitattributes
# Track large binaries with LFS
*.pth filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.onnx filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.bin filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# Explicitly EXCLUDE MLflow metadata files
meta.yaml !filter !diff !merge
mlflow/**/meta.yaml !filter !diff !merge
